                    <p>We’re Christopher and Shawn, the founders of DRIVER. What <br>makes us good friends and business partners is our passion for <br> people, creative solutions, sustainability, and electric vehicles. <br> One weekend, during a backpacking trip in the San Bernardino <br> National Forest, we discovered we could make a positive impact <br> on our planet even after we left the forest. Thus, DRIVER was <br> born. Through self-sustainable vehicles, we could prevent carbon <br> emissions from harming the environment. With one rental <br> company, our goal is to inspire the community and the world to <br> opt out of renting gas-powered vehicles and rent sustainable <br> all-electric cars instead.
